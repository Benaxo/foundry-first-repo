# Titre : Un smart-contract pour financer et g√©rer des fonds

## Description :

This project is a smart contract developed with Foundry that allows to finance and manage funds in a secure and transparent way. This project is my first smart contract developed with Foundry and aims to demonstrate the possibilities of blockchain technology for fund management.

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
